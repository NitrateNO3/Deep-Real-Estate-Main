 * The home page — three screens.
 *   1 · header + search + welcome        (back to exactly one screen)
 *   2 · maps, closed by the stats strip
 *   3 · featured & top properties
 *
 * The strip rides at the bottom of screen 2 rather than standing between the
 * two screens. At 104px it is far too short to hold a screen of its own, and
 * riding the bottom of the maps screen puts it exactly where it was asked for —
 * after maps, before properties.
 *
 * Screen 2 alone is `min-h-dvh`, since it is the one now carrying the extra
 * 104px and would otherwise overlap on a short laptop. 1 and 3 are locked to
 * `h-dvh`.
